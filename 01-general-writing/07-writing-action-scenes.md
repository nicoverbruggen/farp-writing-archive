# Writing Action

So... if you're reading this article, you may just know some about writing well. It's possible you've got a plot. You've got your scenes. You may even be revising your work. But there's still something wrong with your action scenes. They're painted out exactly onto the paper as they are in your mind, all the descriptions and everything. It's frustrating...- you've got the scene out perfectly – except the mood is like a peaceful sunrise.

Bleh.

Action is fast-paced, not slow like a sunrise. Of course, everyone knows that. But there's always the question on how to get the action RIGHT. Everyone's been at this point at sometime, and it can take a long time for people to realize what to do. Once they realize? It seems so obvious that they're hitting themselves about not seeing it before.

Believe me. I've been there myself.

Okay...-.I will give a series of suggested steps to perfect your writing with. There is an example that was pulled out of thin air, and its not from any writing I've seen, just to tell you. But the thing about the example is that the feel of action is non-existent. The example is an exaggeration of what you'd normally put in so you can see the differences between the changes more clearly. As I go through the steps, the passage will improve accordingly.

So, are you ready? Here is the example scene:

> Janis leapt into the air, clearing the large, granite boulder without touching it with his plain, brown leather boots. He saw a glint of metal out of the corner of his eye and turned to see a huge ugly monstrosity of a troll swinging a large, engraved sword, made by dragons by the looks of it, at the boy. Jumping backwards, Janis avoided the sword and countered with his rapier, its strong, plain blade holding up to the strength of the beast.

> Then, the dark figure that he had been trying to catch and slay came into his view, laughing as it readied its bow and aimed a deadly, but fine looking, shaft at Janis. At the same moment, the troll swung its sword. The arrow fortunately only grazed Janis's arm and he dodged the sword, causing it to miss, but only by a couple inches. When the arrow struck, Janis did not avoid it completely, since it grazed his arm. The figure nocked another arrow, but that was when Janis decided to make his move, not wanting to be caught between the troll's sword and the dark figure's arrow. The boy leapt.

It's really boring, isn't it? It would be good, except there's so many aspects that it needs serious help with. Your action section may or may not needs as much assistance as what this selection does. You could be further along in the steps that I will give. But even so, I suggest you read each step in order to get more understanding of how to perfect your scenes.

First step: either dump or spread out the description.
That's right. If you're all tense and in a battle, do you notice little details? Or would you notice that they're about to hit you with their sword? I think it's the latter...-. Tons of description will bog down your action. Use more description in more relaxed, lazy times! I'll bring up the sunrise again. With that, if you want to paint an awe-inspiring scene of the sheer beauty and wonder, description is your uttermost friend! But in action, it is your worst enemy.

> Janis leapt into the air, and cleared the boulder easily. He saw a glint of metal out of the corner of his eye and turned to see a huge troll swinging a sword straight at the boy. Jumping backwards, Janis avoided the sword and countered with his rapier, its blade holding up to the strength of the beast.

> Then, the dark figure that he had been trying to catch and slay came into his view, laughing as it readied its bow and aimed a deadly shaft at Janis. At the same moment, the troll swung its sword. The arrow fortunately only grazed Janis's arm and he dodged the sword, causing it to miss, but only by a couple inches. The figure nocked another arrow, but Janis made his move, knowing he had no other choice. If he didn't, either the arrow or the sword would get him. The boy leapt.

Better...-..but still needs serious work.

Second step: better choice of words!
If the action is quick, use words that imply speed or rapidness! Fast-paced words are crucial in fast-paced action, because without them, there won't be such a rapidness implied when the actions are done. Instead of hit, try strike. Glint – flash. Turned – whirled. Get it yet? Ah, I'll do another example...-.

> Janis leapt into the air, clearing the boulder easily. He caught a flash of metal out of the corner of his eye and whirled to see a huge troll swinging a sword straight at the boy. Leaping backwards, Janis avoided the blade, then countered with his rapier, its blade holding up to the strength of the beast.

> Then, the dark figure that he had been trying to catch and slay jumped into his view, laughing as it aimed a deadly shaft at Janis. The figure fired, and the troll swung its sword. The arrow fortunately only grazed Janis's arm, and the sword missed by inches. The figure nocked another arrow, but Janis made his move, knowing he had no other choice. If he didn't, either the arrow or the sword would get him. The boy leapt.

Once again. Better. Notice that I did not change that many words, but yet the change in rapidness is not evident. However, if you keep those slower-paced words the way they are, when you are finished, it will really show how much it affects the mood of your scene. Also, take care not to use the same fast-pace word over...-.and over...-and over. That will bog down your work just as much as the slow-paced words.

Third step: Shorter sentences.
Subject – verb sentences are better for action. They're faster than other sentences. Like your action should be. Don't believe me? Seems awkward? Then look at the example.

> Janis leapt into the air. He cleared the boulder easily. Eyes caught a flash of metal. Janis whirled to see a huge troll swinging a sword straight at the boy.Janis leapt backwards. His rapier countered the sword. Amazingly, the blade held up to the strength of the beast.

> The dark figure jumped into view. Janis had been trying to catch and slay it. The boy heard it laughing. He watched as it aimed a deadly shaft at Janis. The figure fired. The troll swung its sword. Though, the arrow only grazed Janis's arm. The sword missed by inches. The figure nocked another arrow. Janis made his move. He knew he had no other choice. If he didn't, either the arrow or the sword would get him The boy leapt.

How's that for comparison? Like it more? I hope so. Think it's better but still needs work? You're right. It does.

Next: short paragraphs!!
If there's something you wish to stress, make it into a teeny tiny paragraph of its own, usually one or two sentences. Doing that puts more tension and makes the short sentences work better. Attention is drawn to whatever you put into a small paragraph.

> Janis leapt into the air. He cleared the boulder easily. Eyes caught a flash of metal. Janis whirled to see a huge troll swinging a sword straight at the boy.Janis leapt backwards. His rapier countered the sword. Amazingly, the blade held up to the strength of the beast.

> The dark figure jumped into view.

> Janis had been trying to catch and slay it. The boy heard it laughing. He watched as it aimed a deadly shaft at Janis.

> The figure fired.

> The troll swung its sword.

> Though, the arrow only grazed Janis's arm. The sword missed by inches. The figure nocked another arrow. Janis made his move. He knew he had no other choice. If he didn't, either the arrow or the sword would get him.

> The boy leapt.

The feeling is achieved. Tension is building. You could stop here. But there's still a couple more things that you can do to enhance the action scene even more, if you wish. The rest is more voluntary, but can be helpful. So even if you are satisfied with this, I suggest you keep reading to find out more.

Next: congruity.
The short sentences don't flow together well yet, because of so much repetition. It could be enhanced by changing the subject-verb pattern in a couple places, but don't do it often, or you may ruin the effect.

> Janis leapt into the air. He cleared the boulder easily. Eyes caught a flash of metal. Whirling, Janis saw a huge troll swinging a sword straight at the boy.Janis leapt backwards. His rapier countered the sword. Amazingly, the blade held up to the strength of the beast.

> The dark figure jumped into view.

> Janis had been trying to catch and slay it. The boy heard it laughing. He watched as it aimed a deadly shaft at Janis.

> The figure fired.

> The troll swung its sword.

> Though, the arrow only grazed Janis's arm. The sword missed by inches. However, the figure nocked another arrow. Janis made his move. He knew he had no other choice. If he didn't, either the arrow or the sword would get him.

> The boy leapt.

It flows a bit better now...-..and I only changed two sentences. However, there's still something more that can be added.

Last: structure and fragments.
Sometimes you can have good wording, but if you change the word order, or make it a sentence fragment you will get the effect more. Yes, it may not be proper English, regrettably, but it can totally change your scene for the better. That is, if you do not overuse it. If you do overuse your fragments, your congruity will be totally ruined and the scene will be stumbled over by your readers.

> Janis leapt into the air. Clearing the boulder easily. Eyes caught a flash of metal. Whirling, Janis saw what it was. A huge troll swinging a sword at the boy.Janis leapt backwards. Rapier countered sword. Amazingly, the blade held up to the strength of the beast.

> The dark figure jumped into view.

> The feared thing. The thing that Janis had been trying to catch. And kill. But it seemed like it would be the other way around. The boy heard it laughing. He watched as it aimed a deadly shaft at Janis.

> The figure fired.

> The troll swung its sword.

> Though, the arrow only grazed Janis's arm. But the figure nocked another arrow. Janis made his move. He knew he had no other choice. If he didn't, either the arrow or the sword would get him.

> The boy leapt.

Better. Much better.

Though this still could be improved, you see! It is a never-ending process...- Play around with your scene! Keep changing it until you get exactly the right feel you want. If you get close, save the scene and copy it to another document so that you have a backup if you mess it up. You don't want to loose all your hard work, do you?

So...-given a few more tweaks along the lines I have given here, a few more details added in a couple places, this could be your end result:

> Janis leapt into the air. He cleared the boulder easily. Eyes caught a flash of metal. Whirling, Janis saw what it was. A huge troll swinging a sword at the boy. Janis leapt backwards. Rapier countered sword. Amazingly, the blade held up to the strength of the beast.

> Like a ghost, like a phantom of the night, the dark figure came into view.

> The feared thing. The thing that Janis had been trying to catch. And kill. But it seemed like it would be the other way around.

> Especially since the boy heard it laughing. Laughing. He watched as it aimed a deadly shaft at Janis, still laughing. But the sound became different. More evil. More deadly. A sound of doom.

> The figure fired.

> Troll swung its sword.

> Janis dodged.

> The arrow only grazed Janis's arm. The blade missed by inches. But the figure nocked another arrow. Janis made his move. He knew he had no other choice. If he didn't, either the arrow or the sword would get him.

> The boy leapt.

Go and compare this to the first example given. See the difference? Try reading them out loud so you can feel the change in atmosphere, tension, and speed. If you want to see more of how the changes I made are essential, you could try removing some of the things I have done to it to see the changes made.

My last tip for you is to try not to overuse any of the suggestions given. Getting the right feel for your action is a delicate balance. Many times the whole thing will have to be changed, whether being reworded, restructured, re this, re that. But don't get discouraged! Actions scenes are hard to achieve effectively. To make my examples better and easier to understand, I had to change them several times. It's normal. Until you get really comfortable, you'll be redoing your scene quite a bit. But the more practice you get, the better you will get.
