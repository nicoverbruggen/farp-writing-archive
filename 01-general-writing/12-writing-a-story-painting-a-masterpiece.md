# Writing a Story, Painting a Masterpiece

I'm an amateur artist; so don't expect too much of me. But just because I'm an amateur, don't think that what I have to say is not worth a few minutes of your time.

I do write somewhat but I did not say I was a writer, why is that? A writer, in my opinion is an artist whose words paint the picture. And every 'painting' drawn or written tells a story.

May this article benefit you in some way, artists of the written word, and mayhaps artist of the other arts.

## It's not 'WHAT' but rather 'HOW.'

It's not what you write about; it's how you write it. Anybody could take a best selling fiction story, an outstanding plot and rip it to shreds by 'just stating' the facts or just telling someone about it, no emotion whatsoever. When writing a story, invoke passion, lust, hatred, terror, or whatever emotion you wish to convey in writing your words. Allow yourself to feel the emotion as you write. If it doesn't move you the way you want it to move your reader, it needs work; it isn't quite there yet. 

Still, if it doesn't move you, don't slash it just yet. It could be that your mind has repeatedly rehearsed it until it's been memorized, there is no element of 'surprise'. You know what's going to happen. The fun is gone. Take a break, do something else, occupy your mind with something else. Or if you're up to it, take it to someone for a second opinion, someone you can trust; take it so far to a third opinion if you want a better scope on your work.

## Seeking a second opinion.

When asking for a second opinion, ask them to be honest. Praise is all well and good at times, but you don't want politeness here, you want to know more about your work. Ask them what they thought about it, what they felt while reading it, the good points and the bad, and perhaps how to better your work. If you handle criticism well, go so far as ask them to brutally attack it like an enemy they must defeat, and to defeat an enemy they must note it's strong points, and it's weak points showing no mercy. 

Take criticism with an open mind and don't see it as criticism aimed to hurt you but criticism aimed to help you. Likewise, try not to take praise as just politeness, but as kind words from one, who means them, from someone who sees and appreciates your hard work. I know it's not easy for some, it's difficult enough for me to remember that, but try to keep that in mind for there is truth in those words. 

## Plot.

Your purpose of writing your masterpiece. It doesn't matter how stupid or dumb the plot is, some of the stupidest plots can be used as the funniest comedies. But a suggestion might I pose, choose a plot that interests you, the more passionate or meaningful the plot is to you, the better. For if you find your own plot boring, how will you convince your readers that it isn't? 

Also, don't restrict yourself with chains so tight that they choke you, if your muse has a different idea than the one you started with, don't discard it just yet. Plots are subjected to change, choose one you think would suit your masterpiece, but try not to constantly change your plot as you write until you have forgotten what your plot is and cannot even understand the plot in your finished work. 

## Characters.

It doesn't matter if it's a human, an animal, a spirit, or even a rock you choose for a character. When introducing or using a character in a story, try to keep in mind that it is a character. With a character comes personality, even the 'lack' of personality is 'personality' as odd as that may sound. 

Humans as well as about almost every character I have come across have feelings, some may feel more strongly than others, and some more aloof. 

Also, when writing words, thoughts, actions, or anything else of a character, try to put yourself into that character's place. As a 'rock' for example, you might want to express solidity, coldness perhaps, stability, remoteness. Try to work that into your work let your reader get to know your characters, even if it is a rock or whatever characters you choose to use. That is the 'color' of your 'painting'.

## Ending.

An Ending varies from cliffhanger, 'happily ever after,' to the slam of a door and on. Choose an ending that fits the plot, the story. If you intend to take it further with a cliffhanger, and can work it smoothly into your masterpiece, so smooth that it fits, then by all means do so. There are no 'Endings,' only beginnings, and guides. The ending you give your readers, is just a fork in the road where you cease to guide them and both of you go your own way. Perhaps you'll 'meet' them again and walk down another trail. Not the End, but a Fork in the Road. May we meet again, thank you for reading.
