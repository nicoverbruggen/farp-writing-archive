# Poetic Forms

## Introduction

Welcome! What follows is a tutorial on writing the various forms of poetry. Although poetry need not (and frequently does not) follow any set 'form,' the forms do exist for those who wish to try them. This article is intended to serve as more of a reference guide to poetry than a start-to-finish tutorial, and the following table of contents is provided with that in mind.

One final note. There are some terms in this guide which, properly speaking, are not exactly 'forms,' and certainly there are many legitimate poetic forms which do not appear here. I have been somewhat arbitrary in my selection of which terms to include. My goal has been to provide information on a wide spectrum of different types of poetry. If you find any mistakes or significant omissions in the information below, however, please let me know! Accuracy is very important to me!

## ACROSTIC

Acrostic poems are very simple; the poet thinks of a word, name, or phrase, and writes it vertically down the page. These letters then become the first letter of each line of the poem. Acrostic poems do not have to rhyme or follow any other requirements, so they are fairly easy to write.

Notice how the word 'fountain' is formed in the following acrostic poem:

Firing upward towards the sky
On wings of foam
Unhindered by oppressive gravity
Neatly forming an arc
That frames the sun in its crescent curve
And delivers a slice of eternity
In its aquatic simplicity
Never tiring of joy.

## BALLAD

'Ballad' is a rather vague term, but in general it refers to poems which tell a story, have a refrain (repeated verses), and are meant to be sung out loud. They are generally folk tales. Ballads vary greatly in length, from a handful of short stanzas to hundreds of lines. The sample below is from the ballad 'Lord Randal' (author unknown).

O where have you been, Lord Randal, my son?
O where have you been, my bonny young man?
I've been with my sweetheart, mother make my bed soon
For I'm sick to the heart and I fain would lie down.

And what did she give you, Lord Randal, my son?
And what did she give you, my bonny young man?
Eels boiled in brew, mother make my bed soon
For I'm sick to the heart and I fain would lie down.

## BALLADE

The ballade originated in France. In the strictest sense, it is a poem of three eight-line stanzas followed by a fourth stanza with four lines. The fourth stanza (called an 'envoy' in this case) is usually dedicated to some prince or patron. The first three stanzas all follow the same rhyme scheme (ababcbcb is a common one) and the fourth stanza also has a rhyme scheme tying it to the rest of the poem, bcbc for example. In a ballade, the a, b, or c rhyme from one stanza carries over to all the other stanzas - in other words, the stanzas are linked in rhyme. Finally, all four stanzas have the same ending line. Not all ballades follow this form exactly; some have seven-line stanzas, others have ten, and the rhyme scheme varies from one ballade to another.

The ballade below was written by Edmund Clerihew Bentley (creator of the clerihew). It is entitled 'The Ballade of Liquid Refreshment,' and it is a departure from the frequently serious subject matter of ballades.

Last night we started with some dry vermouth;
Some ancient sherry with a golden glow;
Then many flagons of the soul of fruit
Such as Burgundian vineyards only grow;
A bottle each of port was not de trop;
And then old brandy till the east was pink
- But talking makes me hoarse as any crow,
Excuse me while I go and have a drink.

Some talk of Alexander; some impute
Absorbency to Mirabeau-Tonneau;
Some say that General Grant and King Canute,
Falstaff and Pitt and Edgar Allan Poe,
Prince Charlie, Carteret, Hans Breitmann - so
The list goes on - they say that these could clink
The can, and take their liquor - A propos!
Excuse while I go and have a drink.

Spirit of all that lives, from God to brute,
Spirit of love and life, of sun and snow,
Spirit of leaf and limb, of race and root,
How wonderfully art thou prison'd! Lo!
I quaff the cup, I feel the magic flow,
And Superman succeeds to Missing Link,
(I say, 'I quaff'; but am I quaffing? No!
Excuse while I go and have a drink.)

Hullo there, Prince! Is that you down below
Kicking and frying by the brimstone brink?
Well, well! It had to come some time, you know,
Excuse me while I go and have a drink.

## BREF DOUBLE

As you might guess, the bref double is a French form. It is similar to the sonnet, but it need not be written in iambic pentameter. The bref double contains three quatrains (four-line stanzas) followed by a final couplet. Its rhyme scheme is axbc xaxc axab ab (where the x's represent lines which do not rhyme with anything else, even the other x's).

I imagine the subject matter of a bref double is normally more serious than it is in the one below, but it provides an ample demonstration of the form's structure nonetheless.

Now William Shakespeare was a man
Who did some writing (so I'm told)
Some say he had a bit of skill -
Perhaps was handy with a pen.

And thinking back now I suppose
I can remember...yes, I can
I've read a play or two of his
(A year, now? How long has it been?)

I can't say I'm his biggest fan
I think some others liked him more
For instance, Mr. Johnson. (Dan?
Was that his name? Or Ben? But still...)

His genius ink in rivers ran
A fine intrepid fellow, Will!

## CINQUAIN

At its most basic level, 'cinquain' simply means a stanza (or poem) with five lines. However, the word also refers to either of two more specific types of five-line poems. The first type is usually centered to give it a diamond shape and has the following format:

First line: a one-word subject or title.
Second line: two adjectives which describe the subject.
Third line: three verbs relating to the subject.
Fourth line: four words forming a phrase, sentence, or set of feelings relating to the subject.
Fifth line: one word which summarizes the poem or restates the subject.

The second and more traditional type is simpler and requires only that the pattern of syllables per line in the poem is 2, 4, 6, 8, 2. (In other words, the first line has two syllables, the second has four, etc.)

The following example demonstrates the first specific type of cinquain:

Pharaoh
Royal, Militant
Commanding, Proclaiming, Leading
He stands for Egypt
King

## CLERIHEW

Clerihews are short, fun little poems that are easy to write. Their name comes from Edmund Clerihew Bentley, who pioneered the form in his teenage years. Clerihews are four lines long and have an aabb rhyme scheme. They are about a specific person, and the second line must rhyme with the person's name. Clerihews are meant to be funny, even silly. There are no restrictions concerning rhythm or number of syllables.

This example is about Frodo Baggins, a character from The Lord of the Rings. (As a reminder, fan fiction of any kind is prohibited on Elfwood.)

There once lived a hobbit named Frodo
Whose stature resembled that of a dodo
He liked to wander, get dirty, and sing
But when he took baths, he always left a Ring.

## DIAMANTE

The diamante is a poem form similar the the cinquain. It consists of seven lines, as shown below:

First line: a one-word subject that contrasts with the subject in line seven.
Second line: two adjectives which describe the subject in line one.
Third line: three verbs relating to the subject in line one.
Fourth line: two nouns related to the subject in line one, followed by two nouns related to the subject in line seven.
Fifth line: three verbs relating to the subject in line seven.
Sixth line: two adjectives which describe the subject in line seven.
Seventh line: a one-word subject that contrasts with the subject in line one.

There is also another, simpler type of diamante which contains only one subject. In this form, the first and seventh lines contain words which are two ways of saying the same thing. The example below demonstrates the former, more complex type.

Growth
Lush, Poetic
Spreading, Flourishing, Multiplying
Youth, Life, Death, Darkness
Shrinking, Dying, Shriveling
Diseased, Fetid
Decay

## ECLOGUE

An eclogue is a poem about rural life, generally a conversation between shepherds, in which country life is usually portrayed in an idealistic way. Eclogues are also known as bucolics, idyls, or pastorals.

The following is the beginning of 'Eclogue I' by Virgil. In the complete poem, the conversation continues to switch back and forth between the two men.

Meliboeus.
You, Tityrus, 'neath a broad beech-canopy
Reclining, on the slender oat rehearse
Your silvan ditties: I from my sweet fields,
And home's familiar bounds, even now depart.
Exiled from home am I; while, Tityrus, you
Sit careless in the shade, and, at your call,
'Fair Amaryllis' bid the woods resound.

Tityrus.
O Meliboeus, 'twas a god vouchsafed
This ease to us, for him a god will I
Deem ever, and from my folds a tender lamb
Oft with its life-blood shall his altar stain.
His gift it is that, as your eyes may see,
My kine may roam at large, and I myself
Play on my shepherd's pipe what songs I will.

## EPIC

Epics are very long narrative poems which typically feature heroic characters, noble deeds, fantastic battles or events, and a high style of writing (epics take themselves very seriously). The excerpt below is taken from a translation of Beowulf, an epic about a hero of the same name. The name of Beowulf's author is a mystery which will probably never be solved.

Soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils
that never he met in this middle-world,
in the ways of earth, another wight
with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared,
sorrowed in soul, -- none the sooner escaped!
Fain would he flee, his fastness seek,
the den of devils: no doings now
such as oft he had done in days of old!

## EPIGRAM

An epigram is a very short poem, usually two or four lines long, with a simple rhyme scheme. The goal of an epigram is to encapulate a brief bit of wit or wisdom in poetic form. The epigram below, written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge about a volunteer singer, is a case in point.

Swans sing before they die--'twere no bad thing
Should certain people die before they sing!

## ETHERE

An ethere has ten lines and no pattern of rhythm or rhyme. Each line contains the same number of syllables as its line number. There is also a reverse ethere, which is the opposite (first line contains ten syllables, second has nine, etc.) and also a double ethere, which usually consists of an ethere followed by a reverse ethere. The example below is simply a normal ethere.

Fear
It rides
In the night
On shadow wings
As a specter of
Some ancient black horror
Which manifests suddenly
On the small, pale, shivering mind
And then, like a half-remembered dream
Dissolves peacefully into nothingness.

## GHAZAL

The ghazal is a Middle Eastern form. It is arranged in a series of couplets, usually five or more. The couplets are independent; each can stand alone as a separate poem and still make sense. The couplets can be thematically related, but this is not a requirement. Ghazals contain a refrain - a word or a short phrase - which appears at the end of both lines of the first couplet and at the end of the second line of every subsequent couplet. The ghazal also has a rhyme which appears, not at the end of the line, but within it, directly before every repetition of the refrain. Ghazals are also required to maintain a strict meter (syllable stress pattern). Finally, a ghazal's last couplet may contain the poet's name as a kind of signature, although this is not required.

The example below does not have this 'signature.' Notice the refrain, 'today,' as well as the '-ite' sound that always precedes it.

I think I'll go outside and see the light today
I plan to grant myself the gift of sight today

No more of this uncertainty and solitude
The humming of the quiet world seems right today

The shadows fall, uncertainty is ever near
But no, the brilliant sun is clear and bright today

How often shades of gray have muddled simple things -
I want to see in crystal black and white today

Now put aside this dismal work for just an hour
I ride to see my children as a knight today!

## GLOSA

In the glosa, a Spanish form, the first stanza serves as the template for the overall poem. Each subsequent stanza elaborates on one particular line from the first stanza and usually contains the line itself at least once as a refrain. (Other, stricter versions of the glosa also exist.) This example's first stanza was written as a complete poem by an anonymous poet, and the rest was added much later by Lewis Turco (writing under the pseudonym of Wesli Court) to form a glosa.

Western wind, when wilt thou blow,
That the small rain down shall rain?
Christ! that my love were in my arms,
And I in my bed again.

Western wind, when wilt thou blow?
When shall the rivers begin to flow
Over this ice toward the sea?
When will the branches of the tree
Drop their mantles of rime and snow?
Western wind, when wilt thou blow,

That the small rain down shall rain?
Then may the willows in their train
Loosen their limbs upon the stream;
Then may birdsong burst this dream
Of winter to seek the sprouting grain,
That the small rain down shall rain.

Christ! that my love were in my arms
Where the grass greens and the bee swarms!
She is fair as the mountain heather,
Comely and kind as Maytime's weather
Over the land after April storms--
Christ! that my love were in my arms,

And I in my bed again
Where gladly I have slept and lain
Upon the pillow of her hair.
When shall I once more come there,
Her breast beneath the counterpane,
And I in my bed again.

## HAIKU

The word 'haiku' is Japanese in origin, and the Japanese idea of its definition is subtle and complex. In English, however, 'haiku' usually refers to a three-lined poem with no pattern of rhythm or rhyme wherein the first and third lines contain five syllables each, while the second line contains seven. For example:

Overhead the light
Is growing ever fainter
Thunder splits the deep.

Haiku are also generally nature-oriented and serious, unlike their cousin, the senryu.

For a sample of authentic Japanese poetry, consider the following haiku by the Japanese master Basho. They are not three separate poems, but rather three different translations of the exact same poem; the contrast between them is meant to illustrate the difficulty of transferring the essence of poetry from one language to another.

The old pond
A frog jumps in
The sound of water.

Old pond
leap - splash
a frog.

Old dark sleepy pool
quick unexpected frog
goes plop! Watersplash.

You may notice that these translations do not follow the five-seven-five syllable pattern. This is of course because they are translations; however, even in their original Japanese, the 5-7-5 rule is often brushed aside in favor of a better word choice. Furthermore, even when the rule is followed, it applies to onji, which have no real English counterpart, rather than syllables. In recognition of this, many Western haiku poets have given up the syllable rule entirely in order to follow in the footsteps of the Japanese haiku more closely. Nothing is ever simple!

## HUITAIN

A Spanish form of poetry, the huitain revolves around the number eight - there are eight lines in the poem, and each line contains eight syllables. The rhyme scheme is ababbcbc. That's all there is to it!

I teeter on the rocky edge
The brink is sheer - but far below
I see another, smaller ledge
On which stands someone else I know
I hear him shout, 'Why worry so?
For even if you fell, you see
You'd still have quite a way to go
Before you fell as low as me!'

## IDYL

(Also spelled idyll.)

There are two separate meanings for 'idyl.' In the first meaning, it is simply a synonym for eclogue. In its other meaning, an idyl is a narrative poem written in high language that deals with an epic or romantic theme. Probably the best-known idyl is Alfred Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King, from which the lines below are taken:

For many a petty king ere Arthur came
Ruled in this isle, and ever waging war
Each upon other, wasted all the land;
And still from time to time the heathen host
Swarmed overseas, and harried what was left.
And so there grew great tracts of wilderness,
Wherein the beast was ever more and more,
But man was less and less, till Arthur came.

## KYRIELLE

The French kyrielle is composed entirely of quatrains (a quatrain is any stanza with four lines). There is no set number of stanzas, although generally a kyrielle contains three or more. The rhyme scheme is up to the poet (aabb ccbb ddbb etc. is frequently used), but it must be the same for all stanzas. Also, the last line of all stanzas is the same. Kyrielles generally have eight syllables per line, although this is not a requirement.

The lines that follow are taken from a kyrielle entitled 'A Little Pain,' written by John Payne.

A little pain, a little pleasure.
A little heaping up of treasure,
Then no more gazing upon the sun.
All things must end that have begun.

Where is the time for hope or doubt?
A puff of the wind and life is out:
A turn of the wheel and the rest is won.
All things must end that have begun.

Golden mornings and purple night,
Life that fails with the failing light:
Death is the only deathless one.
All things must end that have begun.

## LAI

A lai consists of stanzas with nine lines each (although some versions do not require a specific number of lines per stanza). The pattern of syllables per line is 5,5,2,5,5,2,5,5,2 and the rhyme scheme for each stanza is aabaabaab. There is no set number of stanzas and the stanzas are not linked to each other in terms of rhyme. Put all this together and you'll get something like this:

Gaze across the land
Heath, still water, sand
The bay.
Would you call it grand
If within my hand
It lay?
All at my command
For the final stand
Today.

Nights grow long and dire
Those who call me sire
Amass.
Purposes grow higher
Dare I start to tire?
The grass -
Swept across with fire
Vast, uncaring pyre
Alas!

## LIMERICK

Limericks are short poems not meant to be taken seriously. They consist of five lines with rhyme scheme aabba. The pattern of syllable stresses is not set in stone, but it is generally anapestic (unstressed, unstressed, stressed). The first, second, and fifth lines contain nine syllables, while the third and fourth have six.

This is a dry and technical explanation for a poem which is, in reality, simple and fun to write. Limericks frequently make slight departures from the 'proper' form, and this is perfectly acceptable. The limerick below gives you an idea of what limericks are all about.

There was once a young fellow whose brain
Was the size of a cereal grain
But his shortage of wit
Was a great benefit
For he failed to register pain.

## LUC BAT

The luc bat is a Vietnamese form of poetry. It means simply 'six eight' due to its pattern of syllables per line: 6,8,6,8,6,8, etc. There is no set length to the luc bat, so it can be as long or as short as you'd like. But what really makes this form interesting is the rhyming structure, which sounds a little complicated but is easy to grasp in practice. The sixth syllable of every eight-syllable line rhymes with the last syllable of the six-syllable line before it, which in turn rhymes with the eighth syllable of the eight-syllable line before it. When the end of the poem is reached, the last line jumps back and rhymes with the first. In other words, the syllables go like this:

* * * * * a
* * * * * a * b
* * * * * b
* * * * * b * c
* * * * * c
* * * * * c * d
* * * * * d
* * * * * d * a

...although of course the poem can be as long as you wish. Remember that it is always the final line of the poem which ends in the 'a' rhyme, linking it back to the beginning.

Hopefully an example will help clear things up.

The grand untarnished sea -
How glorious for me and you
To wander as we do
Along its beach and through the tide!
How can I harbor pride
Now walking here beside the shore?
Can you, my love, ignore
The sigh, forevermore to dwell
Within our glassy shell?
The gleaming stars, which fell to earth -
What was their glory worth
Beside the gentle birth of life?
What need have we for strife?
The two of us, dear wife, are free!

## NONET

A nonet has nine lines. The first line has nine syllables, and each line after that has one less, until the end is reached with only one syllable. Nonets need not have any rhyme or meter.

A spider on a window screen sees
An insect on the other side
It manages to kill it
But cannot get its bulk
Through the thin wire mesh
And so it must
Be content
With mere
Death.

## ODE

Odes are traditionally serious, dignified poems about a specific subject or event. There are many different types of odes, so numerous and varied that I will not attempt a listing of them here. This means that odes often have a fairly rigid structure, but what that structure actually is varies greatly from one ode to another. The lines below form the final stanza from John Keats' legendary 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.' They are characteristic of the lyrical and poetic beauty that odes possess.

O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
With forest branches and the trodden weed;
Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
As doth eternity: Cold pastoral!
When old age shall this generation waste,
Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou sayst,
'Beauty is truth, truth beauty, -that is all
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.'

## PANTOUM

Pantoums are composed entirely of quatrains (four-line stanzas). There is no restriction on the number of quatrains, but each quatrain must follow the rhyme scheme abab within itself. The characteristic feature of a pantoum, however, is its repetition. The first and third lines of every stanza (except the first stanza) are identical to the second and fourth lines of the previous stanza, respectively. For the final line, there is an additional rule: the second and fourth lines must be the same as the first and third lines from the first stanza, respectively. Thus the overall pattern of lines in a five-quatrain pantoum would be as follows:

Stanza #1: 1 2 3 4
Stanza #2: 2 5 4 6
Stanza #3: 5 7 6 8
Stanza #4: 7 9 8 10
Stanza #5: 9 1 10 3

In some cases, the final stanza is as follows:

Stanza #5: 9 3 10 1

Again, pantoums may be any number of stanzas; the use of five quatrains above holds no special significance (although some stricter versions of this form do require exactly four stanzas).

An example pantoum, 'Rising Sap' by Mabel Ferrett, follows.

After all earth is dead,
all lovely things undone,
a crocus rears its head,
gold to the sun.

All lovely things undone
until a shaping force
-gold to the sun -
re-aligns its course;

until a shaping force
I feel, but cannot know,
re-aligns its course
as dry roots grow.

I feel, but cannot know,
how in the end all things
as dry roots grow
burst into blossomings,

how in the end all things
with effortless delight
burst into blossomings,
dazzling the sight.

With effortless delight
after all earth is dead,
dazzling the sight,
a crocus rears its head.

The pantoum was originally derived from the pantun.

## PANTUN

A Malay form, the pantun can consist of two, four, six, eight, or even ten lines; the most popular form is four. Four-line pantuns have the rhyme scheme abab, and each line generally contains eight to twelve syllables. The distinguishing feature of a pantun, however, is the relationship between the first and second pairs of lines. The first two lines establish an opening image or idea, while the second pair creates a separate image which quite often has nothing whatsoever to do with the first pair (although this is not always the case). The example pantun below is part of a series of pantuns meant to be recited during a betrothal ceremony.

So many beads in this jacket here,
Of many colours and threaded neat;
All those visiting are welcome here,
Here's water to cleanse your feet.

## PARADELLE

The paradelle is French in origin, and it is one of the more difficult forms. It consists of four stanzas, each of which contains six lines. Each of the first three stanzas has the following format: the first two lines are identical, the third and fourth lines are identical, and the last two lines use all the words from the first and third lines (and no others). The fourth and final stanza's only requirement is that it use all the words from the first and third lines of the previous three stanzas (and no others). The example below illustrates.

The frenzied pace of life
The frenzied pace of life
To death it swiftly speeds
To death it swiftly speeds
The pace of life to it
Frenzied, death speeds swiftly.

Our time is scattered dust
Our time is scattered dust
How short our fleeting hours
How short our fleeting hours
Is time our scattered hours?
How short this fleeting dust!

Mortality, the wind
Mortality, the wind
They are a single soul
They are a single soul
A soul, the single wind
Mortality they are.

This dust, mortality
Single, they are scattered
To frenzied death it speeds
How short is time? The hours?
A swiftly fleeting pace
The soul wind of our life.

## QUATERN

A quatern has four stanzas, each of which has four lines. Each line contains eight syllables. It does not have to rhyme, but it does follow a specific pattern of line repetition: the first stanza's first line is repeated as the second stanza's second line, the third stanza's third, and the final stanza's fourth. This form originated in France.

Enough of somber, grim attire!
No longer will I dress in black
To greet events which should be glad
Why be so formal? Let it go!

A wedding is a time of joy
No longer will I dress in black!
Why bundle in hot stuffy clothes?
Are T-shirts wrong? Are blue jeans bad?

The Reaper comes arrayed in black
Now truly, can we follow suit
To greet events which should be glad?
Why, Death himself is no such fool!

Tuxedos are for penguins best
And darkness fits the raven well
But we, unfeathered as we are
Why be so formal? Let it go!

## RENGA/RENKU

The renga and renku are two separate but very closely linked forms of poetry. The renga was created first, in Japan; later, the Japanese master poet Basho began working with renga and developed his own form, similar to the renga but generally shorter, subtler, and placing less emphasis on knowledge of esoteric literary works. This new form, which came to be called the renku, is more popular than its predecessor in modern Japan. (More recently two other forms, the rengay and renshi, have also popped up.)

So now we've had our history lesson - but what is a renku? There are many varieties of renku, each with its own particular set of requirements, but in general renku are poems written by two or more people, one stanza at a time. The stanzas are short, two or three lines, and each stanza links to the one before it in some subtle but discernible way. In this way the complete renku can be seen as a demonstration of how several poets' minds work together to form a unified poem which nevertheless retains the inviduality of its separate parts. The stanzas which follow are from the beginning of 'A Winter Shower,' written by five poets in 1684; the fourth stanza was written by Basho himself.

A cloud, trying to enwrap
The moonbeams, momentarily fails -
A winter shower.

Someone walking on icy patches,
Making lightning in the water.

The New Year's hunter,
On his back a quiver
Adorned with ferns.

The northern gate is open
And the beginning of springtime.

Over a fan
That brushes away the horse dung,
A hazy breeze.

The tea master loves
Dandelion flowers on the roadside.

At home the young maiden
Reads an ancient romance
In a lovely pose.

Two decorated lanterns
Competing to reveal the depth of love.

## RETOURNE

Like so many other French forms, the retourne is all about repetition. It contains four quatrains (four-line stanzas), and each line has eight syllables. The trick is that the first stanza's second line must also be the second stanza's first line, the first stanza's third line is the third stanza's first, and the first stanza's fourth line is the fourth stanza's first. Retournes do not have to rhyme. Consider the following example:

Peruse the wide and distant sky
What gifts of glory do you see?
Perhaps a wisp of cloud appears
Or maybe sunlight streams across.

What gifts of glory do you see?
How perfect is the firmament -
A panegyric to the world
That shames the sapphire with its light.

Perhaps a wisp of cloud appears
It cannot mar the cosmic sphere
But rather complements its scope
And makes it august all the more.

Or maybe sunlight streams across
As from the dusk or coming dawn
Or clear and vibrant down from noon
To sweep the placid world below.

## RICTAMETER

A rictameter is a nine-line poem. Its pattern of syllables per line goes 2,4,6,8,10,8,6,4,2. Also, the first and last lines must be the same.

A tree
It stands alone
In the heart of a field
Unheeded by the world around
Its roots an inverse network of branches
That anchors it to the cool earth
No tapestry has form
Or hue like this
A tree

## RONDEAU

Originating in France, the rondeau is a three-stanza poem consisting of approximately ten to fifteen lines total, generally with either eight syllables per line or ten. Its distinctive features are the use of only two rhymes throughout the entire poem and a half-line refrain which begins the first stanza's first line and forms the entirety of the second and third stanza's last lines. The rhyme scheme, of course, varies with the number of lines; a typical rhyme scheme for a fifteen-line rondeau is aabba aabC aabbaC, where C represents the first half of the rondeau's first line. The refrain does not rhyme with anything else in the poem.

For example:

You give your love to one unwise
I have ignored your faithful sighs -
I know you can't be unaware
Of days when I seem not to care -
I've stilled your tongue with pleasant lies.

But in the hours that banter buys
I see the lonely girl who cries
The heart that empty words can tear -
You give your love.

The ancient logic still applies:
The sapling in the winter dies.
How often, if I'd just been there
To run my fingers through your hair
Yet still it lingers in your eyes -
You give your love!

The rondeau has spawned several other very similar forms, including the rondel, roundel, rondelet, and rondine.

## RUBAIYAT

Created by Omar Khayyam, the rubaiyat - a Middle Eastern form - contains an unlimited number of four-line stanzas. The rhyme scheme for each individual stanza is aaxa, and this rhyme does not carry over to the next stanza. (In some versions of the rubaiyat, the rhyme is slightly different - aaba bbcb ccdc dded etc.) A rubaiyat should also be iambic (syllable stress pattern of unstressed, stressed).

These lines were written by Omar Khayyam himself.

WAKE! For the Sun, who scatter'd into flight
The Stars before him from the Field of Night,
Drives Night along with them from Heav'n, and strikes
The Sultan's Turret with a Shaft of Light.

Before the phantom of False morning died,
Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried,
When all the Temple is prepared within,
Why nods the drowsy Worshiper outside?

And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before
The Tavern shouted--Open then the Door!
You know how little while we have to stay,
And, once departed, may return no more.

## SENRYU

The senryu, a Japanese form, is structurally identical to its cousin, the haiku. The difference between them is subject matter; haiku tend to deal with nature, while senryu are about humans and human nature. Humor, also, is more acceptable in a senryu than a haiku. These somewhat vague criteria make a fuzzy, indistinct dividing line between the two forms, and many poets believe that a single poem may be both a haiku and a senryu. But, as Shakespeare says, 'What's in a name?' It's the poem that matters.

Mother and her child
Nighttime cocoon of warm light
Keeps the world at bay.

## SESTINA

Sestinas, like so many other French forms, are all about repetition. A sestina contains a grand total of seven stanzas - the first six containing six lines each, and the final stanza (in this case called an 'envoy') with three. Originally, the sestina had restrictions on meter and number of syllables per line, but these rules have largely vanished - which is fine, because sestinas are difficult enough without them. The explanation is a little complicated, so bear with me.

The main idea of the sestina is that all of the first six stanzas use the same six line-ending words, arranged in a different order each time. For instance, say that the last word in the first line of the first stanza is 'hope.' We'll assign 'hope' the number 1. Now say that the last word in the second line of the first stanza is 'fire.' We'll give 'fire' the number 2. Continuing in this way, we can say that the first stanza's lines end in words numbered 1 through 6. So the first stanza's pattern is simply 1-2-3-4-5-6.

With this in mind, we proceed to the second stanza. For stanzas two through five, the order of ending words depends on the stanza before it. In each case, the order is last, first, fifth, second, fourth, third. So the second stanza's ending word pattern is 6-1-5-2-4-3. In the same way, the third stanza refers to the second stanza to get its pattern, 3-6-4-1-2-5. Thus the overall pattern of ending words for the first six stanzas is as follows:

1-2-3-4-5-6
6-1-5-2-4-3
3-6-4-1-2-5
5-3-2-6-1-4
4-5-1-3-6-2
2-4-6-5-3-1

It's interesting to note that if we were to repeat this pattern for a seventh stanza, we would be back to our original 1-2-3-4-5-6. However, the seventh and final stanza follows a different pattern. It has three lines. The ending word pattern for it is 5-3-1, but there is an additional restriction; the other three ending words must be used in the middle of the lines, in a specific order, as follows:

2-5
4-3
6-1

(Some versions of the sestina are less strict, demanding only that all six words appear in the envoy at some point.)

In the example that follows, the ending words have been highlighted and numbered to make this easier to understand. Note that this sestina does not follow the form shown above for the last stanza. It was written by the Italian poet Dante.

I have come, alas, to the great circle of shadow,(1)
to the short day and to the whitening hills,(2)
when the colour is all lost from the grass,(3)
though my desire will not lose its green,(4)
so rooted is it in this hardest stone,(5)
that speaks and feels as though it were a woman.(6)

And likewise this heaven-born woman(6)
stays frozen, like the snow in shadow,(1)
and is unmoved, or moved like a stone,(5)
by the sweet season that warms all the hills,(2)
and makes them alter from pure white to green,(4)
so as to clothe them with the flowers and grass.(3)

When her head wears a crown of grass(3)
she draws the mind from any other woman,(6)
because she blends her gold hair with the green(4)
so well that Amor lingers in their shadow,(1)
he who fastens me in these low hills,(2)
more certainly than lime fastens stone.(5)

Her beauty has more virtue than rare stone.(5)
The wound she gives cannot be healed with grass,(3)
since I have travelled, through the plains and hills,(2)
to find my release from such a woman,(6)
yet from her light had never a shadow(1)
thrown on me, by hill, wall, or leaves’ green.(4)

I have seen her walk all dressed in green,(4)
so formed she would have sparked love in a stone,(5)
that love I bear for her very shadow,(1)
so that I wished her, in those fields of grass,(3)
as much in love as ever yet was woman,(6)
closed around by all the highest hills.(2)

The rivers will flow upwards to the hills(2)
before this wood, that is so soft and green,(4)
takes fire, as might ever lovely woman,(6)
for me, who would choose to sleep on stone,(5)
all my life, and go eating grass,(3)
only to gaze at where her clothes cast shadow.(1)

Whenever the hills(2) cast blackest shadow,(1)
with her sweet green,(4) the lovely woman(6)
hides it, as a man hides stone(5) in grass.(3)

## SIJO

The sijo, a Korean form of poetry, consists of three lines, each approximately fourteen to sixteen syllables long. There is no meter or rhyme. Normally the first line sets up the scene, the second line adds an interesting twist or change, and the third line resolves the first two lines, sometimes in an unexpected way, giving a sense of finality. Sometimes the three lines are split into six to make the poem easier to read.

As so often happens, prose descriptions of this poetic form are inadequate. Look at the example below, written by Yon Sun-do, and see for yourself what a sijo is.

You ask how many friends I have? Water and stone, bamboo and pine.
The moon rising over the eastern hill is a joyful comrade.
Besides these five companions, what other pleasure should I ask?

## SONNET

The sonnet. It is one of the best-known and best-loved forms of poetry in the Western world. Lax enough to permit freedom of expression but restrictive enough to be challenging, long enough to allow detail but short enough to force concision, sonnets have endured for centuries and are still written today.

A sonnet is a poem with fourteen lines and a strict rhyme scheme, written in iambic pentameter (ten syllables per line, stress pattern of unstressed, stressed). There are many types of sonnets, each with its own rhyme scheme, but whichever rhyme scheme is chosen, it must be carefully followed. For example, the Shakespearean sonnet rhymes abab cdcd efef gg. There is also the Italian sonnet (also known as the Petrarchan sonnet, after its creator), which can rhyme abbaabba cdecde or abbaabba cdcdcd, among other variations. The Spencerian sonnet rhymes abab bcbc cdcd ee. There are others as well, but the exact rhyming pattern chosen is less important than the overall effect of the sonnet on its reader. Also important to note is that many sonnets contain a turning point at the end of the eighth line, dividing the poem into an octet (the first eight lines) and a sestet (the last six).

Choosing a single sonnet to show as an example was no easy task. Shakespeare's Sonnet XVIII and Sonnet LV are well-known and excellent, as is Percy Bysshe Shelley's 'Ozymandias' - the latter is my personal favorite poem of all time, sonnet or otherwise. In the end, though, I decided on Edna St. Vincent Millay's incredible 'Love is Not All.' Note how the poem shifts direction at the conclusion of the eighth line.

Love is not all: It is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain,
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink
and rise and sink and rise and sink again.
Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breath
Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;
Yet many a man is making friends with death
even as I speak, for lack of love alone.
It well may be that in a difficult hour,
pinned down by need and moaning for release
or nagged by want past resolution's power,
I might be driven to sell your love for peace,
Or trade the memory of this night for food.
It may well be. I do not think I would.

## TANKA

The tanka is a Japanese form. As with the haiku, the definition of exactly what constitutes a tanka has been 'lost in the translation' to some degree. Various poets and experts will give various definitions of the form, some stricter than others. For those of us writing in English, however, the main idea of the tanka is that it is a five-line poem with a syllable-per-line count of 5-7-5-7-7. The subject matter of a tanka tends to lean towards personal feelings and the intricacies of human interaction, as in this example.

Early summer dark
Children are catching fireflies
Crickets in the grass
In the cool air together
We count the numberless stars.

## TERZA RIMA

Terza rima is a fairly simple verse form developed in Italy. It contains an unlimited number of three-line stanzas (called 'tercets') with the rhyming pattern aba bcb cdc ded efe... Each tercet's middle line gives the rhyme for the first and last lines of the next tercet. The last tercet's middle line provides the rhyme for a final stanza containing one or two lines.

I can think of no better example of terza rima than Percy Bysshe Shelley's 'Ode to the West Wind,' from which the following lines were taken. Note that in this example, there are no breaks between tercets.

O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being—
Thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes!—O thou
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill—
Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere—
Destroyer and Preserver — hear, O hear!

## TERZANELLE

The terzanelle is a hybrid of two other types of poetry, the terza rima and the villanelle. It consists of five tercets (three-line stanzas) followed by a quatrain (four-line stanza). The pattern of rhyming and line repetition appears below. Lower case letters represent rhymes, while capital letters represent entire lines.

A(1) B A(2)
b C B
c D C
d E D
e F E
f A(1) F A(2)

Alternately, the final stanza may be:

f F A(1) A(2)

The terzanelle below was written by Lewis Turco under the pseudonym of Wesli Court.

This is the moment when shadows gather
under the elms, the cornices and eaves.
This is the center of thunderweather.

The birds are quiet among these white leaves
where wind stutters, starts, then moves steadily
under the elms, the cornices and eaves.

these are not our voices speaking guardedly
about the sky, of the sheets of lightning
where wind stutters, starts, then moves steadily

Into our lungs, across our lips, tightening
our throats. Our eyes are speaking in the dark
about the sky, of the sheets of lightning

that illuminate moments. In the stark
shades we inhabit, there are no words for
our throats. Our eyes are speaking in the dark

Of things we cannot say, cannot ignore,
This is the moment when shadows gather
shades we inhabit, there are no words for
this is the center of thunderweather.

## TRIOLET

The triolet form is French in origin. It is simply any poem which follows the rhyme and repetition scheme shown below (where lower case letters represent rhymes and capital letters represent entire lines).

ABaAabAB

An example is shown below.

I'd like to ride the silver wind
And leave the planet in my wake
The heavens all around me bend
I'd like to ride the silver wind
By stellar pools that never end
Above the wide uncharted lake
I'd like to ride the silver wind
And leave the planet in my wake.

## TYBURN

A tyburn has six lines. The first four lines contain a single two-syllable descriptive word each, and the final two lines contain nine syllables. Lines one and two make up the fifth stanza's fifth through eighth syllables, while lines three and four are the sixth stanza's fifth through eighth syllables. The rhyme scheme is aaaabb.

I have to admit that I personally dislike the tyburn. It is needlessly limiting and makes artistic expression extremely difficult - writing a tyburn is like filling out a form, and I think the example below reflects that. But, hey - maybe someone will fall in love with it and write a bunch of fantastic tyburns.

Poring
Boring
Soaring
Roaring
Over textbooks poring - boring day
Better to be soaring, roaring! Play!

## VILLANELLE

The villanelle is a French form with a heavy emphasis on repetition. It follows the structure given below (in which lower case letters represent rhymes and capital letters represent entire lines).

A(1) b A(2)
a b A(1)
a b A(2)
a b A(1)
a b A(2)
a b A(1) A(2)

Probably the most famous villanelle ever written is 'Do Not Gentle Into That Good Night,' by Dylan Thomas, and it is an excellent poem besides.

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light!

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light!

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light!

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse me, bless me, now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light!
