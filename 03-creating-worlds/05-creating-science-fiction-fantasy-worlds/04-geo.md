> And God said, 'Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear.' And it was so. God called the dry ground 'land', and the gathered waters he called 'seas'. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, 'Let the land produce vegetation: seed bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.' And it was so. 

# Day 3: Geology & Botany

The third day dawns over the seas, but the climate is only the first stage of developing a complete environment for you world. Now we turn our attention to the land. The physical world you build for your story will affect the civilizations and characters in both subtle and dramatic ways. A desert is more than hot temperatures; it is a geographic feature that lacks water, with all the implications for life there. Mountains create rain forests on one side and rain shadows on the other. A jungle and the river system associated with it are features of the land that will affect the people, their cultures, and civilizations that live there. Cultures and religions will reflect the needs and blessings offered by the geography. Plants are an extension of the Geography. Lush oasis, vast grassy plains, fertile valleys, and towering forests are essentially geographical features.

In other words, you may have to go back to Day 2 and revise your climate systems as you build your landscape. That will be the case at every step of the process. The goal is to build a whole world where all the parts work together. That way nothing will seem contrived or out of place to your readers. Geography has a profound impact on the cultures and civilizations in your world.

For example, the fertility of the soil caused by the annual flooding of the Nile empowered Egypt to become one of the earliest world powers. An army has to eat. But in order to do their job the soldiers have to train instead spend all their time plowing fields. Tradesmen have to have time to work on weapons and chariots instead of plows and carts. But because the floods renewed the topsoil every year, Egypt was often able to bring in two whole crops per year. Egypt could feed its whole population and afford to feed a full-time army, a huge priest class, and still export food. The pyramids and temples were not built on the backs of slaves, but mostly by Egyptian farmers who where out of work for three months while their fields were underwater. The annual flooding cycle is also at the core of Egyptian religion.

Why did Japanese Samurai carry thin, sharp swords, while European Knights wielded thick broadswords? The answer is geology. The orient is iron poor, while in Europe iron is common and close to the surface. This means that Europeans had enough metal to make armor out of it. Their swords have to be strong enough to smash through that armor. In China and Japan, even though metallurgy was more advanced, iron is rare enough that you couldn't afford to waste it on armor. You need it for tools and weapon blades. Since the armor is made from leather and polished wood, the sword needs to be able to slice through it.

## The Map

If you haven't done it already, this is the time to make a map.

The first rule of making maps of your fantasy world is very simple: until the map is published in your book don't consider it final. Always be open to changing your map, even scrapping it altogether and starting over. Be willing to experiment, move whole mountain ranges and rivers around. Tolkien's original maps of middle earth pictured it as a ship floating on the outer sea.

So be willing to keep your map fluid. Your story will both suggest the physical layout of the world, and the map you come up with may influence your story, suggesting geographic obstacles that your heroes must overcome, or nations that are allies or enemies based on their proximity to valuable resources or strategic points.

As you slowly map out your world ask questions.

* How much population can the land support?
* This is a function of fertility of the land, the availability of water, the rain and weather or in the absence of these, the availability of food and water through trade.
* What kind of foods can be hunted or farmed?
* What kind of natural resources are available for trade and industry? Where are the mineral deposits, metals, mines, magical crystals, oil, trees for lumber and fuel?
* Where are areas of magical and/or religious significance? Are some kinds of magic stronger in some areas and weaker in others?
* Where are the trade routes to import needed goods and food that cannot be provided locally?
* Towns will often spring up in the middle of very inhospitable terrain if there is a natural stopping place or crossing along major trade route, or if there is a valuable resource (like a silver mine). If those resources are used up or the trade routes move people will leave, even to the point of abandoning the town.
* In pre-industrial societies towns usually form along waterways. Streams and rivers provide a ready source of water and sewage disposal, a source of food (fish), and transportation links with towns up and downstream. Depending on the tech level, rivers also can provide water-wheel power.
* What natural barriers separate peoples, nations, and empires? Mountains can be virtually impassible for an army. Wide rivers are hard to bridge even for relatively advanced civilizations. Ferry's are a lot easier to build, but it takes a long time to ferry an army over a river.
* What areas are prone to natural disasters: flood, hurricanes, blizzards, earthquakes, or volcanoes? How do those disasters figure in to the religious beliefs or superstitions of the people living there? How do they cope and protect themselves from these problems?

The point again is that geographical features will affect the world around them, often in very subtle ways. Those affects need to be felt in the world of your story and the world will come alive, and your readers will love to visit it. They will read it again and again, and anxiously await sequels.

Look back at what you've already developed on previous days. Is the technology of your civilization based on some sort of semi-mystical spice that can only be found on one desert planet? What effect does that have on the religions and interstellar politics of your universe? Keeping with the 'Dune' theme, is the world of your story a vast desert with only a few oasis? Water will be an overriding concern for the civilizations living in your world.

Also don't forget that places change over time. Rome and Carthage fought the Punic Wars primarily over Spain. Both cities were competing over trading routes over the Mediterranean Sea. That meant they needed ships. Ships built out of wood. Wood is fairly scarce in north Africa and Italy didn't have many forests either. Spain did. Spain is not known for it's forests anymore, over the centuries all those forests were cut down, mostly to build ships and as the population grew, for cooking fuel. England realized this to a certain degree, and though they eventually built more ships than Spain ever did, they planted whole forests of oak to supply their shipbuilding industry.
