# Let Us Make Man in Our Image: Anthropology

As the sixth day progresses we now get to the most important part of this series, developing the cultures, civilizations, and races that populate your world. This section involves a whole mess of ology's. It involves history, culture, social structure, politics, technology, religions, social morality, codes of honor and ethics, government, the military, sexuality and gender roles, biases and prejudices, racism, education, language...

According to the Genesis narrative human beings have two fundamental traits: they are created in God's image, and they are divided into male and female sexes.

## Sentience & Spirituality

Aside from all the theological discussion about what it means to be 'created in God's image', primarily what it is that humans are free moral agents with the capacity for creativity, rational thought, language, and emotion. It also implies that humanity has a unique place in the natural order. Since you are creating your own world, you get to determine in whatever image you want the races of you're your world to be. The title of this section 'Anthropology' is a bit of a misnomer, since your fantasy or sci-fi universe is likely to contain non-human races. What races will you have in your universe? What are fundamental characteristics of each race? In what ways will different races in your world conflict and cooperate? How do the different races or classes connect spiritually and physically with the world around them?

Created 'in God's image' also indicates that humans are spiritual beings with both a unique relationship with our creator, and a relationship with the physical world that is deeper than the physical senses. You get to develop the depth and breadth of the spiritual dimension of the characters in your story.

For example, in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the elves are tied to the world physically and spiritually. That is why the are immortal, they live as the world lives. Their role seems to be shaping and beautifying the world and caring for the creatures that live in it. Humans, on the other hand, have the gift of mortality. Their spirits were created to yearn for something beyond the world, and when they die, their souls leave the world for places and purposes unknown to all but God. The dwarves were fashioned by Aule, the spirit of rock and metal, as servants to literally help build the world and to repair the damage caused by the conflict with evil.

## Sex, gender, & family

Humans are psychologically, morally, emotionally, spiritually, socially complex creatures. At the heart of all that complexity is sexuality and reproduction. How the sexes interrelate and procreate is fundamental to human society.

In the Genesis creation account the division between male and female is a fundamental part of humanity. Currently there is tremendous debate and controversy over the implications of that division. Are there inherent difference between men and women? Are the 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus' stereotypes about the differences between the sexes inherent and fundamental or the effects of cultural indoctrination and discrimination? Since you are the creator of your own world, you get to decide.

The entire Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan is an exploration of this issue. He has created a magic system in which men are naturally more adept with fire and earth magic while women are more adept with wind and water. Men are naturally stronger than women are individually, but women have the ability to connect together geometrically increasing their power. He further complicates this by adding the 'taint' to the male side of the True Source of magic that drives any male who can connect to the True Source destructively insane. With this foundation he gets to explore across his world various cultures that have different cultural expectations of men and women, different family structures, patriarchal and matriarchal social structures.

The complexity of human society is so great that a child needs 15 to 20 years to learn how to successfully live in one. This is why the family unit is the basic social unit. It is the place where children are taught the basics of language and social interaction, social norms and gender roles. In many societies it is also where you learn your basic trade.

That is why the structure of the family in a human society affects the whole social structure built on top of it. Many ancient cultures where polygamy (one man with multiple wives) was practiced viewed women as property with the marriage arrangement a variation on the man purchasing the woman from her father.

I once heard a speaker from India commenting that eastern & mid-eastern cultures think one of the greatest crimes in western cultures is that we force young people to base their decision to marry each other on mutual affection and sexual attraction. In their cultures, older, wiser adults arrange the marriage on what they think would make a strong, life-long relationship. Instead, he said, Americans and Europeans leave the decision up to the two people whose minds are the most clouded by hormones. No wonder, he said, that your marriages fall apart so easily.

Several societies have tried to supplant the family. Sparta pulled young boys away from their mothers and integrated them into military barracks by age 5. That way they could ingrain their martial values into new generations. Our civilization is right on the edge of a cultural revolution as we enter the 'Genetic Age'. Cloning, artificial wombs, genetic screening and eugenics, and cultural forces like the acceptance of homosexual marriage and the accompanying ideas of polygamy and polyarmory are poised to radically re-define the family. (And biotech and cybernetics are poised to radically re-define what it means to be human.)

Since you have the benefit of creating your world from the ground up, you get to determine the structure of the family and how and where sexuality fits in with things. You could create reptilian races where the young hatch from a nest never knowing a parent. Or a species like the Cuckoo bird that lays it's egg in a different bird's nest where the chick will eventually take over the nest, killing the other chicks. You could create a species that spend part of their life cycles as males and then become female.

## Social structures - priest, warrior, worker

Beyond the basic structure of the family (or whatever institution you replace it with), and the larger structure of the clan, human societies larger than a few dozen people quickly segregate into three basic categories (or castes): priest, warrior, and worker. The priest caste includes religious leaders, magic users, artisans, and intellectuals. The warrior caste is self-descriptive, and the worker caste contains the farmers, merchants, and tradesmen. Sometimes tradesmen and merchants are given their own caste. Be aware that this 'caste' breakup is an over simplification and that in reality there is usually a lot of overlap. Some societies bolster these caste division with religious doctrine, like the Hindu's caste system, or with law, like the Roman Emperor Domition's 'dominate' system (which forced all people into hereditary jobs - you dad was a blacksmith so you will become a blacksmith) that far outlasted the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages up till the time of the Industrial Revolution.

Different cultures will elevate different classes over others. For example at the core of the struggle between ancient Athens and Sparta was that Sparta idolized the warrior class while Athens idolized the intellectual class. In Feudal Japan the farmer (often the lowest social rung in many societies) was held in almost as high esteem as a warrior. But merchants were despised. They were seen as greedy, willing to make a buck at others expense, only selling things that others produced.

The downfall of the feudal system that governed Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire was not the rise of the Renaissance intellectual, but the rise of the worker caste (especially the tradesmen and merchants) into the middle class and upper classes.

Often these castes are in conflict, but it is not always the case. Hitler was able to unite the workers (by destroying all union and communist opposition), the academic class (infatuated with Darwin's idea of 'favored races' and Niche's concept of the 'superman') and the military by making Nazism the de-facto religion of Germany. In ancient Sparta the priest who worshipped Ares actively supported the total domination of their society by the warrior caste.

## Social Class

Another side effect of this social division is the evolution of social classes. In any society there will be those with the intelligence, cunning, resources, skill, connections, family, brutality, greed, ambition, or luck to dominate the cultural structure. What kinds of traits will different societies favor in their upper classes? What sort of traits will denigrate them to the lower classes?

In most societies, those in the power classes tend to view the traits that got them there as virtues. Thus their very success in reaching the top (or staying there) is a testament to their inherent superiority over the those in the lower classes.

## Morality and Values

What's right, what's wrong, and how do your characters decided between them? What are the consequences for violating moral standards? Go back to Day Zero and think about the social and personal implications of the theology you've set up. What are the sexual morays of the culture(s) in your story? What is the value of human life? Are members of one caste or class more 'valuable' than others? According to the Code of Hammurabi (the first written legal code) a person from a higher class could murder a person of a lower class with only a minor fine. Murder of a person of the same class might result in corporal punishment and a fine. Murdering a person in a higher class was a capital offense. Keep in mind your social structure. In a society dominated by the warrior there will always be a tendency toward a 'might makes right' morality. Worker societies are more likely to be dominated by a strong work ethic, or, if the merchant is the dominant, by profit. Priestly societies will base their morality on the principles of their religion.

## Religion

We've discussed this topic from the perspective of the divinities in your world. But you also need to look at it from the character's point of view. How is religion expressed culturally and personally? What temples, shrines, or churches will your characters' cultures build? What are the qualifications and cultural roles of priests? What does worship look like? Are there sacrifices, feasts, or regular worship services? What is the relationship between the religious and political structures? What is the cultural authority of the religion (how much will people follow or ignore the religious leaders)? What kinds of religious ideas will the culture reject? If people violate religious taboos what will be the consequences? Does everyone believe it, or just play lip service to it? Does it reflect the real will of any divinity or is it a social fabrication? If the religion is a fabrication, where did it come from? How have religious practices evolved over the years?

## Medicine & Science

In many ancient cultures the physician was the priest. The priest, philosopher, and scientist were the same person. The human, being a unity of body, mind, and spirit, needed a physician who could cure problems of the body, mind, and spirit. Classically, philosophy referred to all academic pursuits. Even today we still give out Ph.D. (doctor of philosophy) degrees in physics, history, mathematics, and medicine. This is why I include all these in the priest caste.

But we need to look at where the rubber meets the road. How are the sick and wounded treated in your world? Are there healing potions? Are there bionic prosthetics? Will it take weeks for a character to recover from a major injury or broken bones, or are their ways to cure him in a few minutes? Are there hospitals, witch doctors, or astral healers? The field of medicine has also frequently been a field where women were allowed power even in male dominated societies.

What unique technologies are available in certain cultures? This is where you go back to Day 1 and detail the technologies used by the characters in your story. What sort of weapons does a particular culture favor: Spears, Swords, Bows, Light Sabers, Six-guns, Summoned demons? What sort of vehicles do they use: flying carpets, flying saucers, horses, powered armor suits, Harley Davidson motorcycles?

## Education

I put this here, because the primary purpose of education in most cultures is to communicate social values and religious doctrines to new generations. Sciences, math, and language are communicated in these contexts. For example, the most literate cultures historically are literate because children need to be taught to read scriptures. On the other hand, in illiterate cultures the religious leadership jealously guards the power that literacy gives them (especially if writing has anything to do with magic). There are also cultures that spurn education and ostracize scholars while placing much value on athletic or military skill. Pre-literate cultures rely on the human memory to record history. So the bard, or the local equivalent will be a person of great importance.

How have the characters and cultures in your world been taught to think? How will this affect their relationships and conflicts with characters of other countries or races? If your characters are going to buck the system, what has broken through their own prejudices?

## Language

I like making up languages for my fantasy stories. My background is in language so I tend to go the Tolkien rout of devising whole languages, verb declensions, script styles, and inflected endings. In fact, I will confess, it's something of a waste of time. I obsess over made up grammatical forms, while I neglect actually writing the story. Remember your goal. Are you trying to write a story, or make up a language? The purpose of a created language (or using a real language) is to make the world, cultures, and characters who speak the language more real, more alien.

One of the most practical uses for a made-up language is profanity. It's a way to make colorful, roguish characters and still keep the story PG. It can also be a tell to cultural values. Why is a word or phrase particularly offensive?

Using consistent language patterns in place names will help create a sense of place. In Lord of the Rings you start out in earthy, normal Hobbiton where everything has very everyday names: The Shire, The Old Forest, The Water, Buckland, Bree, Staddle, the Last Inn. But you know you're not in the Shire anymore as they near Moria and suddenly you get names like Zirak Zigil, Carathras, Nimrodel, and Lorien. As you enter Gondor every hill has the word 'Amon' in its name and cities have names like Osgiliath and Pelargir.

One other area where language will affect your characters is in your characters' names.

While developing the languages for all the aliens in Star Wars, George Lucas' standard practice was to combine two languages, borrowing the grammatical structure from one language and the vocabulary from another.

Usually you only need to develop a base vocabulary. Try to keep the culture in mind, especially if you're writing for non-human beings. Reptilian species you might want to have a lot of sibilant consonants: s, sh, t, th for them to hiss out. Feline species you might want lots of rolling r's and nasals like n and m.

## Literature

Generally you can lump all cultures into two broad categories: literate or illiterate. Of course, there are varying degrees of partial literacy. Illiterate cultures rely heavily on the mnemonic power of poetry to record thoughts, history, and information. Just as partially literate cultures rely on specialized scribes to write and read, illiterate cultures rely on bards whose job is to remember and pass down the tales, songs, and records.

The power of writing profoundly impacts a society, from the simple ability to accurately keep accounting records to the permanent recording of written law. Oral tradition is easily corrupted or even destroyed by time, but written records can persist long after the culture that wrote them down is forgotten. Similarly, people are often quick to believe a story if it has been written down. Readers are prone to assume a writer has properly researched a topic.

In pre-electronic cultures, literature, poetry, and music are the primary forms of private entertainment. Before radio and TV came along, people filled those 'prime-time' hours sharing tales, songs, writing and reading letters to each other, reading stories. Watching the news was going down to the local inn and listening in on the conversations.

In societies where the priest caste is predominant the primary literature will be scriptures or spell books. In worker societies the literature will tend toward entertainment. Warrior societies will have long heroic epics that extol a warrior's strength and honor. In other words, what kind of people will your culture consider heroic? That will be what their literature is about.

## Entertainment

How do people in your culture spend their leisure time? Generally the more advanced a culture becomes the more leisure time they have. Over human history we've come up with an endless list of ways to entertain ourselves: drama, athletics, combat, music, poetry, stories, spectacle, dance, gaming, dining, drinking, recreational drug use, of course there's always that 'oldest of professions'. Entertainment comes in two basic flavors: spectator and participatory. What kind will your culture(s) prefer? In addition there are two sub-flavors: individual and team. What kinds of entertainment will the people in your culture prefer? What do the activities your culture entertains themselves with say about that culture.

Remember that cult classic movie 'Rollerball' (not the recent re-make). The government used this brutal form of roller derby to promote a communal attitude in the populace. They wanted to denigrate individual achievement and emphasize teamwork. The conflict arises because an individual player becomes so successful that he threatens that message. So the government that secretly controls the games, tries to have him killed.

How is entertainment paid for? Are artist's self-supporting, free to charge for their products with ticket sales? Are artists sponsored by government, church, rich private, or corporate interests? Do those interests control what the artists can say, or who wins?

## Art

Art, of course, encompasses most forms of cultural expression, but I'm referring specifically here to the visual arts, painting, drawing, and sculpture. In a priest society you might see elegant stain glass windows, ubiquitous sculptures of divinities and saints. In a warrior society the sculptures would depict heroes, weapons, and memorialize great battles. Art in worker societies oddly tend to feature recreation, what people get to do when they finally get to stop working.

## Architecture

Architecture is primarily a function of environment and available resources, but it also reflects the technological level of a culture. Italy and Greece have relatively abundant marble, so many of their buildings use it. In Egypt where sandstone and clay are common but wood is very rare, they used sun-dried brick. Bricks in Europe had be fired or else they would dissolve in the rain so they tended to use wood since it was abundant, or stone in areas, like Scotland, where wood was less available. In China, the abundant bamboo and timber became the primary building material.

Greek and Roman architecture is open: a series of open rooms surrounding a roofless courtyard. This is because of the relatively mild Mediterranean climate. In northern Europe rooms were closed, equipped with a fireplace, and windows glassed or shuttered, because of the much cooler and wetter climate.

Building height is also a function of technology. There is a limit to how many stories tall a tower can be simply because of the limited strength of stone. Habitable buildings cannot be much more than six levels tall unless you have some sort of elevator system.

You might also want to include elements from your magic system in your buildings: floating buildings, organic buildings grown from magically manipulated trees, structural integrity fields (or their magical equivalents) that allow super strong structures that look almost unsupported, like half-arcs, spirals, or bizarre curves. Cities under constant threat of attack will have strong defensible buildings with few windows, thick city walls, and usually little aesthetic qualities. Rich, populous, and secure cities will have open buildings, an emphasis on making buildings look pretty, and any city walls will be viewed more as an obstacle than a defense.

Architecture offers visitors to strange cultures (like the readers of your book) clues to the culture's main values. If the largest, most elaborate building in the city were a temple or cathedral, what would you think is the dominant force in that culture: priest, warrior, or worker? What if the largest building is a coliseum, a fortress, or the palace of the king? What if some 300 level corporate headquarters dominates your city's skyline? In 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' the cathedral and the imposing Palace of Justice dominate the skyline. The conflict in the story is symbolized by the conflict set up between these two buildings at opposite ends of the city and the ideals they represent.

## Fashion

Fashion and clothes are great clues to a society and culture. How people present themselves and how they are required to be presented is an easy way to communicate to a reader important information about a new character.

* Sexual Morals: how revealing or modest a dress can tell how prudish or wanton a culture might be
* Social Values: Warrior cultures will feature martial clothes if not outright uniforms. Worker cultures often feature earth tones, especially if you're going for a rustic look. Priestly cultures often tend toward ostentation and can be as stratified as a martial culture. What kind of culture might feature androgynous unitards?
* Social Class: finer fabrics and elaborate clothes for the rich, simpler, courser and patched fabrics for the poor
* Social Roles: jobs usually have some sort of uniform, official or unofficial: a chef's hat, a maid's apron, a lady's fan, a woodsman's hood.
* Resources and Trade: What fabrics are produced locally, what can they import? Fur, leather, cotton, wool, silk, linen, synthetics, feathers, etc., need to be available or obtainable by trade. Poor folk will usually have clothes made from local materials while richer folk will wear finer, imported fabrics.
* Environment: Cold environments need warmer clothes with less revealed skin, warm environments need less clothes usually exposing more skin. Hot environments tend to need clothes again. What kind of environment would you think a culture lives in where everyone wears acid-resistant, plastic raincoats?
* Religion: Many religions strictly dictate fashion. Usually they are in line with other social and cultural roles, but often they exist only to distinguish the 'wes' from the 'thems'. From the turbans and ceremonial knives worn by Sikhs to the rosary beads worn by nuns to the color coded shawls of the Aes Sedai.

## Food

Different cultures and races eat different foods and often view food differently. Except for Swedish Meatballs. According to Ambassador G'kar of Narn from Babylon 5 every culture has a version of Swedish Meatballs. If your food is heavy on the garlic, your probably eating Italian (especially southern Italian or Sicilian). If your food is spiced with paprika it's probably Slavic, the French tend to use onion, Scandinavians use allspice, Indian uses curry, and Mexican favors peppers. But more than just regional taste, food is often reflective of many other aspects of culture.

How is food eaten? Chopsticks? Forks? A Shared Knife (as in medieval Europe)? A multivitamin Tablet? I.V.?

Do people sit in chairs around a table, kneel at a table, or recline? Are there restaurants, inns, taverns, commissaries, messes or other public eateries?

Can men eat with women, or children eat with adults, or is that considered improper?

What are a culture's rules about hospitality? In cultures where food is scarce or hard to produce, food and sharing meals together is a big deal, even sacramental. Are certain animals or foods sacred or unclean? Are some foods poisonous? Are certain foods reserved for special times and occasions, like Chinese moon cakes, Jewish Passover matza, or roast turkey at American Thanksgiving? What foods are identified with certain societies, like the English and tea?

I know this tutorial is overwhelming (it was overwhelming to write it). The point is not that you have to include every detail, every aspect of human society in your world (as if this were an exhaustive list). I wanted to throw out a lot of different ideas so that you can pick and chose a few, maybe a few you hadn't thought of, that will help you flesh out your world and make it more real to your readers. I've put together a Civilization Worksheet that will allow you to condense all the aspects of this over-long section into a simple single reference page.

## Economics

You've heard the cliché, 'He who has the gold makes the rules.' This tends to be true in cultures dominated by the worker caste. In societies dominated by the priest cast it tends to work the other way round: 'He who makes the rules gets the gold.' And in warrior societies it's 'He who has the largest army makes the rules and takes the gold.' So, as you create a world for your Fantasy or Science Fiction story, important questions to ask are: how does money work in your world's cultures, and who controls the money?

### First question: How does money move around?

Barter: the most basic form of exchange: I give you something that you want if you give me something I want. Goods and services are exchanged for goods and services of similar value. A good bargainer tries to give something easily obtained or made for things much more difficult to produce.

Medium of Exchange: a specific commodity or resource begins to serve as a medium of exchange and the value of goods and services are calculated according to that resource. So the value of all materials in an economy might be calculated based on bushels of grain, strings of beads, ounces of salt or silver, or mystical psycrystals.

Coinage: now the government begins to get involved. The government regulates the medium of exchange by making coins with fixed weights and official images stamped on them. Gold is ideal for this purpose because of how soft it is, making it easy to stamp in official seals or images of Caesar's face. Coinage can become the victim of the economic force of inflation, where the government tries to increase the amount of coins in circulation by diluting the purity of the metal in the coins.

Paper: the government begins to issue special cheques that have their value backed up by gold in a kingdom's vaults or grain in the kingdom's granaries. These evolve, like coins, into special, government-printed bills. Eventually, the bills may not even reflect the value of the standard on which they were originally based, but have their value determined by money markets of competing currencies.

Credit: at this point no actual coinage or paper needs to be exchanged, only information that money has changed hands. The appropriate amounts are transferred between financial institutions and the only thing that's actually changed is the numbers in the accountants' spreadsheets.

### Economic Structures

Now we need to consider who controls the money. Lets look at some of the economic structures of societies. Many different structures can exist side by side. Even in a bustling free market economy there can be specific locals operating at only a subsistence level or in rigid socialist societies there can be very active black markets.

Subsistence: A community produces only (or almost) enough goods and food for their own immediate use. Subsistence cultures have little division of labor. Everybody has to be a jack of all trades, make their own clothes, grow their own food, make their own tools, defend their own property.

Trade I: individuals begin producing enough goods to have a surplus. You begin to get division of labor, or specialization. Since Farmer Jones and Farmer Green can produce enough food for three families, Bill Smith can devote all his time to the forge. The new, and better tools, make Jones and Green even more productive and so Fred Carpenter can now afford to spend all his time on the edge of the forest working wood.

Trade II: At this stage communities begin to trade with other communities. Whole communities begin to specialize based on local resources, cash crops, or industries. Trade networks begin to develop. If defense wasn't a problem before, the security of trade routes becomes an issue now. Villages are founded for the express purpose of exploiting a specific resource or because of their location along a trade route.
This is important because individual communities cease to be self-sufficient. They are dependent on essential supplies through the trade network. This makes them vulnerable to disruptions, like natural disasters or invasion. It can also make particular communities strategic targets for thieves, raiders, pirates, enemy empires, or the forces of darkness.

Colonialism/Imperialism: An imperialist economy is designed to funnel resources from the colonies to the imperial center. Usually this leads to fairly extreme forms of exploitation to increase the profitability of the colony. England in the 18th century held human liberty in high regard, yet they looked the other way at the growing slave trade and continued to deny a political voice to the American colonies because they were making so much money off them.

Free Market: In free market economies the government and business theoretically stay away from each other. The economy is ruled strictly by the laws of supply and demand. The government's role is to protect the market from artificial, political, criminal, and dishonest forces from affecting the supply/demand equation. The weakness of a free market system is that demand can be manipulated by cultural forces (i.e. fads). The free market is also amoral. If there is a demand, (for example, prostitution, narcotics, assassination) someone will try to fill it. How will the forces of culture try to curtail these tendencies?

Mercantilism: In a mercantilist economy the government uses its political and military power to benefit specific domestic industries usually through protectionist trade policies. This is indeed an example of those having the gold making the rules. The industries and business are privately owned (in contrast to Socialism in which the companies are government owned), thought the line between government and business is blurred. The guild run cities of late medieval Europe were mercantilist governments, run largely by the most powerful business interests in the city. In some cases private companies are given extensive political power. For example throughout the 1700s and well into the 1800s the East Indian Trading Company ran the English presence in India and the Hudson Bay Company ran the colonies in much of Canada. These companies were allowed to have armed security forces and ships to enforce English rule. Their ship captains were given rank in the English navy, even though their ships were privately owned. Their managers were given full diplomatic authority to negotiate trade agreements that essentially operated like treaties. In effect the East India Company was a branch of the British government, but the money it made went mostly into the shareholders pockets instead of the government treasury.

Corporatism: Corporatism is an extreme version of Mercantilism in which the private companies actually begin to supplant the government. Corporate security forces take over the role of police and military. Private transport companies take over the delivery of mail. Corporate training programs replace education systems. People live in company owned or financed housing blocks. Most areas of the economy are monopolized and smaller business are bought out or squashed by their larger cousins. What municipal or national governments that are left are totally controlled by the business interests that put them into power.

Socialism: Socialism is the opposite of Corporatism. Under socialism the government strictly controls all aspects of the economy including private business: prices, wages, imports, exports, productivity, hiring policy, new construction. Socialist governments often take over whole sectors of the economy (usually starting with health care) replacing the corporate bureaucracy with government bureaucrats. Money and profits from the economy are funneled directly into government coffers. Of course government bureaucracies are usually even more inefficient than corporate bureaucracies, and just as prone to corruption. Economies are vast complex webs of relationships that defy efforts to micro-manage.

Communism: In an ideal sense communist societies have no private property. All property is owned communally (hence the name). There are no rich or poor, because nobody has anything, everyone shares everything. Goods and services flow freely 'from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.' In practice, however communism is a very difficult society to maintain. All it takes is one or two greedy or lazy people to threaten the whole system and they have to be eliminated or 're-educated'. Without the economic motivation of wealth what values motivate people to contribute to your communistic society? How do you transfer goods and services freely from each according to their ability when some have considerably more ability than others do? How do goods flow freely to each according to their needs when so much of any economy is based on fulfilling wants, not needs? Who needs a Rolls Royce, or yachts, or a 52-inch plasma TV? Who really needs a TV at all (and the whole entertainment industry behind it)?

## Governments

We've already got a pretty good article on FARP about governments, so I'm not going to go into a list of government types. What I want to look at is making sure the governments of the countries, races, and planets, etc. integrate into your whole structure.

### National Governments

As you've put together the cultures in your world, look at the relationship between their values and how their governments are structured. What will the government look like for a society dominated by the warrior caste, or worker, or priest? If you're going to create an evil, totalitarian empire for your good guys to fight, consider how they got that way. Oppressive fear rarely works well or very long. Just look at the Soviet Union. Hitler's rise by inspiring people; feeding people a line about safety, power, and empowerment; by uniting the people against scapegoat enemies like the Jews or the Jedi. At least a certain percentage of a population has to buy into the tyrant's vision for the tyrant to come to power without a lot of civil unrest or all out civil war.

### Military

What is the purpose of the nation's military: offense, defense, or civil order? Offensive militaries are designed to attack and conquer other countries. Defensive militaries are formed by nations who fear being attacked by countries with offensive militaries (real or imagined). Nations structure their military for civil order when they plan to use their army as police to enforce martial law (because the leaders fear their own people).

How does one become a part of the military? Do they draft conscripts? Do they impress unwilling people? Do they only accept volunteers? Do they only allow people from certain economic or social classes? Do they hire mercenaries? Does being in the military offer people special perks or social benefits?

What kind of special training do soldiers receive? What kind of special training do officers receive?

How does one advance in the military: skill, patronage, loyalty?

How competent is the military? How loyal? How independent? Is the military under civilian control, or are the civilians under military control?

### Internal Politics

Countries are rarely monolithic. There are political parties, regional dynamics, ethnic groups, sub cultures, religions, generation gaps all working together. Even single cities have Chinatowns, boroughs, and neighborhoods with their own unique cultural flavors. These different groups often have radically different cultures based on radically different values. For example, different castes usually worship different deities in a pantheon, holding different festivals, eating different foods, attending different entertainment venues. They may even have different governments. In ancient Rome the upper-classes ran the senate. Only members of the upper class could run or vote for senators and consuls. The plebes, the lower class, could elect a Tribune of the Plebes. For a brief period the Tribune was the most powerful person in Roman politics.

Often in Fantasy or Science Fiction all these subtleties are glossed over to simplify the setting to focus on the main point of the story. That's not a bad thing to do. You can get caught up in the minutia.

### Local Government

Many times the local government of a village or town will be quite different from that of a nation. Even under an incredibly autocratic imperial leader many of the towns maintain a fairly independent and democratic government. Likewise, even in the most democratic countries, you can still find areas dominated by a violent criminal gang or single individual, like the owner of the local factory. Local governments, even more than national governments reflect the cultural values and morals of the community.

### Law Enforcement

How will the civilizations in your world enforce their rules? One of the 'rubber meets the road' issues in the world of your story is how your characters will interact with the authorities that run your world. Most of what we've been doing in this tutorial so far is setting up the rules by which your world operates. What happens when your characters cross the line and break the rules? Who goes after them? What happens when they are caught? Who tries them? How are they punished?

Who enforces the law?

Self: you get your own justice. In many ancient cultures, if you couldn't hunt down and kill a criminal yourself, you weren't a real man and deserved to get robbed. Often called 'frontier justice', this sort of justice tends to lead to cycles of escalating revenge.

Watch: In many isolated towns and villages the constant threat of attack by raiders, roaming bands of ogres, packs of hell hounds, and other beasties require a group of men who volunteer to maintain a constant watch over the town. Since they're already keeping an eye on things, they might as well keep and eye out for petty thieves, murderers, con artists, and other ne'er-do-wells too.

Constable: The constable is the watchman free of his duty to serve as an on-call defensive military. The constable is also a professional, not a volunteer. As such, the constable patrols the street keeping an eye out for thieves, murderers, con artists, and other ne'er-do-wells full time. Usually constables do not have the authority to use deadly force.

Sheriff: The sheriff is charged with keeping the peace. So his role is not so much solving crime as maintaining civil order, stopping crimes before they start or apprehending criminals caught in the act. Sheriffs can have a lot of unofficial discretion about the application of their authority. This is because a sheriff is selected by the people of the community. Sheriffs also have the power to use deadly force. A unique power of the sheriff is the authority to deputize civilians as fully empowered law enforcers.

Marshal: The marshal usually does not patrol, but pursues criminals. The marshal has more official authority than the sheriff does. His jurisdiction is broader, and he has the official authority to act as something of his own judge, jury, and executioner. The marshal's extended authority derives from a higher level of government.

Fed: The fed is an agent of the national government and their authority trumps the local authorities. They are still constrained by whatever rules the legal system places on law enforcers.

Street Judge: This guy, taken from the Judge Dredd comic, is police, judge, jury, and executioner. He has broad authority in the pursuit of criminals, the gathering of evidence. The arrest of a criminal is also the trial and sentencing hearing.

Detective: The detective is a special category of law enforcement. Instead of patrolling to prevent crime or to catch criminals in the act, the detective is called in after a crime is committed and given the job of figuring out who did it and catching them. As such they have the power to search for and gather evidence and question suspects.

Bounty Hunter: The bounty hunter is a marshal for hire. They are private citizens given the authority to pursue criminals and bring them to justice. Because they operate outside the constraints of department they can get away with a lot of abuse of the 'rules'.

Enforcer: Unlike the sheriff who keeps the peace, or the marshal, who pursues criminals to bring them in for trial, the enforcer's job is 'preemptive punishment'. They don't bring you back for trial, they just beat you up for violating the rules. A society that uses enforcers rarely pays any heed to 'civil rights' even in the best of cases.

Secret Police: or State Police operate outside the chain of the legal system. They have both the full resources of the state and the freedom from its rules. In the name of state security, you can justify a lot of things: torture, arrest without cause, search and seizure, even murder. The secret police operate (as the name suggests) covertly. They rarely wear uniforms and employ many informants and spies, often through blackmail.

Consul: In places under martial law, the military doubles as the police force. In ancient Rome the consul's power derived from a document that allowed the general to execute soldiers for disobeying orders. Thus the military governor has nearly absolute powers in the exercise of his authority. In other words, he can have you executed just because he wants to, no trial, no defense, no evidence.

### Punishment

How are rule breakers punished? Punishment serves three basic purposes: prevention, deterrence, and restitution. Imprisonment, execution, exile, or amputation all have the side-effect of preventing a criminal from repeating their offense. Harsh punishments, like torture, caning, or public display are designed to essentially scare both the punished and other prospective criminals from choosing to break a law.

The third idea is that punishment should bring justice. That a criminal must pay for the harm they have done to their victims and the rest of society by violating the rules. These punishments will usually line up other cultural values. Societies that value freedom will imprison people, considering the removal of freedom to be drastic enough a punishment for most crimes. Societies that value social order tend to harshly punish even minor offenders. Societies that value money will often impose fines. A society of magic users may de-magic a convicted wizard. A society of warriors might reduce a criminal to a menial slave laborer. The most common punishment in ancient Rome was banishment. What worse punishment could a Roman think of besides having to live in someplace less than Rome?

Punishments also reflect what a society considers just to the victims and society. Mild offenders are frequently sentenced to 'community service' repaying the damage they did to society by forcing them to contribute in a way a society might deem constructive. We imprison criminals not just to punish them, but also to protect people from the other crimes they might commit. This is also the logic behind cutting the hand off a thief or castrating an adulterer.

Generally speaking, the more primitive or frontier a culture, the more personal the justice system. In many ancient cultures individuals were responsible for their own protection and justice. If you caught someone stealing from your shop, you could summarily cut off their arm without involving any local authorities. If the guys in black hats shot your brother-in-law and carried off your sister, it was your duty to don your white hat and go after them, not run like a coward to the local sheriff. Many cultures (especially those dominated by the warrior caste) hold to trial by combat. From the dueling floor in Hamlet to Main Street in Tombstone, Arizona it is not uncommon for two disputants to settle their differences at the point of a weapon, hand-to-hand, or spell against spell. The theory being that the gods, fate, or some universal law of poetic justice would guide the aim of the righteous and somehow impede the guilty forcing them to loose.

Of course this kind of cowboy justice tends to leave a high body count and lead to increasing rounds of violence. Enter the magistrate. Courts are an effort to fairly apply the rules; first by taking as much of the emotion out of the argument as possible and rely on logic and evidence. A major breakthrough in many ancient societies was to write the law down. Written law allows for fairer enforcement.

Modern cultures seek to stop the abuse of power by law enforcement by acknowledging rights like habeas corpus (the right to know what crime you're being accused of) and limits on the power of police to search and seize private property.

## History

This is where you pull it all together.

Once you've got a basic map, a list of the major political, religious and economic forces (the nations, states, governments, churches, guilds) you want to construct a bit of a history. You need to answer basic questions like:

* Why does this nation have the government it has?
* What is the history of the conflicts between the warrior, worker, and priest castes?
* What is the history of the conflicts between different nations?
    * Nations that are dominated by the worker caste will fight over trade and resources.
    * Nations dominated by the priest caste will fight over philosophy and doctrines.
    * Nations dominated by the warrior caste will fight over territory and strategic objectives.
* What are some of the defining events?
    * Natural disasters, plagues, or supernatural calamities
    * Wars, invasions, conflicts
    * Life or reign of notable political/military/religious leaders

For most of the areas on your map this history doesn't need to be more than a paragraph listing the race(s) who live there, who the current king or leader is, the basic government and cultural type, the dominant religion, and any special resources or technologies they might possess. Those areas that directly affect the story, the more detailed you want to make this history. You especially want to detail the cultural and political forces that directly influence your characters. This can help you greatly with character development, giving you clues to who they are, why they make the choices they make, what conflicts they will have with other characters from other backgrounds.

I know this tutorial is overwhelming (it was overwhelming to write it). The point is not that you have to include every detail, every aspect of human society in your world (as if this were an exhaustive list). I wanted to throw out a lot of different ideas so that you can pick and chose a few, maybe a few you hadn't thought of, that will help you flesh out your world and make it more real to your readers. I've put together a Civilization Worksheet that will allow you to condense all the aspects of this over-long section into a simple single reference page.
