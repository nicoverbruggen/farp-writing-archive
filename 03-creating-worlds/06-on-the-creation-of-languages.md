# On the Creation of Languages

One of the biggest problems I've seen with many invented languages is that their creators are not interested in making them user-friendly; they're interested in making them look cool. They have seen how some foreign languages (from the perspective of English-speakers anyway) use different accent marks, apostrophes and dashes, for example, the tilde (ñ) that Spanish-speakers use. They decide that theirs should use the accents too, and rightfully so. They give pronunciation hints to the readers who don't speak and assumedly know nothing about the language. However, many make the mistake of squishing all of the following: å, ë, í, ò, û, ç, and ñ, a dash or two, and a handful of apostrophes into one word, which does not help the reader at all. It leads to a confusing mess.

The best way to bypass this sort of confusion is to familiarize yourself with the accents and to limit yourself. I usually stick to the following concepts when creating a language for fantasy/sci-fi.

Create the general idea of the race before the language, not vice versa. Language is just as much a part of a character as anything else, and it's much easier to find clothes to fit the character than a character to fit the clothes.

Know how the sounds of the letters are created (how you hold the tongue) and classified (nasal, hard palate, soft palate, etc.) Though it seems like a simple baby sound-making exercise, know how the sound of each letter is made will help you craft your own sound system better; the sounds must flow together or it will sound like gibberish.

Don't have too many irregularities. Make words at least vaguely pronounceable on sight, or it will disrupt the flow of reading.

Don't use more than two accents/dashes/apostrophes per word. Then your words will look like real language and not obviously made-up nonsense. The point of language is to communicate, and it should look realistic.

Study the phonetics/pronunciation of letters in foreign languages. Dead/dying languages are especially good for this, as they often use letter combinations and diphthongs that the modern world has assimilated or changed.

Follow and understand speech cadence/intonation. Some people's intonation goes down at the end of their sentences, while others' go up. Questions sound different than exclamations or statements. Make sure that your own words have a natural rhythm to them.

Reference pronunciation styles. Give readers a real-world reference for your pronunciations. For example: 'ç pronounced like S in sun, as in French Provençal.' (See next; do not actually include this example in-text. Use it either as a footnote or, preferably, indicate it in the pronunciation guide).

Include a pronunciation guide, rules list, and concise dictionary of common words. On Elfwood make this a separate item in the Library and preface the work that uses it with a reference to it. If you're really gung-ho you can create and add a grammar guide, verb list, conjugations, etc. The sky is the limit. Some people like to sit down with a guide to a given language and study its basics, learn some elementary phrases, et cetera. I've been known to speak in my smatterings of Gaelic, and I'm sure more extraordinary languages have popped up in similar situations. Give the readers a 'toy' to play with.

Don't underestimate the power of roots and stems. As any student of Latin or Greek will tell you, if you know the roots and stems, the actual words are crazily simple. Creating words is much easier (not to mention incredibly consistent) if you have a system to work with.

Languages are based on rules. This is probably one of the most important rules of structured language. In order to function, in order to be coherent, a language MUST have rules. This is why grammar is taught and re-taught and why many English teachers are so strict about it (if this is a revelation to anyone let me know…); because the words must be in the proper relationship to each other to make any sense. A list of rules on the theme of, 'This sound may only begin a word, this sound never ends a word, this sound only occurs after the letter H,' etc. will be helpful to anyone caring to dissect the continuity of your creation.

In creating a language, one is by no means required to give it intricate grammatical structure enough to make English look like a joke, though it would be good if it had structure enough that a reader could piece together a few complete sentences that are not included in the original work. Some authors have achieved this; the most well known today is probably J.R.R. Tolkien, of whose fourteen languages is best known for Elvish. The language has two branches: the high-elven tongue called Quenya and the grey-elven tongue called Sindarin, both of which follow the same pattern. They are based on Finnish, but there are a few components of other languages incorporated into them, such as Old Norse and Middle English. Granted, Tolkien was a linguist, but he understood what many would do well to discover: language must be able to be used. Some colleges now offer classes that explore and teach Tolkien's languages with an emphasis on Elvish. Try speaking your own language when you have a few simple sentences. If you stumble over it a lot or find that it sounds too strange to mean anything, change it. Revise and work with it until it sounds like speech.

I began my language with the vowels, as they play a vital part in the sound of the language and usually do the most changing. Érachan (AIR-ah-khan, derived from the Gaelic Errakan meaning, 'the people that come from the moon.') has seven vowels derived from various languages, and the irregularities are marked by accents. The consonants are relatively the same as in English except for a few. A full version of it will hopefully be appearing on Elfwood soon preceding its story and epic poetry.

Here follows a list of things that a languages should have and be presented in, but the long and short of it is that if you would buy it for a language class like Spanish or French, then you could make it for your own language.

* Pronunciation guide
* Verb list
* Concise dictionary
* Rules list
* Grammar guide
* Runic/writing system (this is a fun one to make if you don't use a pre-made one like Anglo-Saxon)
