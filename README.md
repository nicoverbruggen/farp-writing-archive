# FARP Writing Archive

![FARP Logo](images/farp-logo.jpg)

[Elfwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfwood) was a popular web-based alternative art gallery and online community devoted to original science fiction and fantasy art and writing. Elfwood had a FARP section, which stood for Fantasy Art Resource Project. 

In this repository, I have archived all posts from the Writing Tutorials section. 

Since Elfwood had been around for a while, the styling of these tutorials were all over the place, so it was also necessary to properly format each tutorial as well: each tutorial can be found as Markdown.

The basis for the archival is [this snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20110723091424/http://www.elfwood.com/farp/writing-tutorials.html) from archive.org.
