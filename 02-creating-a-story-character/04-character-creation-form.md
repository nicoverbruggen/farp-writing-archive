# Character Creation Form

In learning more about creating characters for my novel I learned far more about creating the world around them, and the history to them then ever I thought I would, or would need to.

A person is not only a personality, but they are experiences, hopes, joys, passions, and foibles all rolled into one little package. For a writer you must not only create these in yourself, but for several, if not hundreds of other people as well. Those with the fullest detail, I have found, are actually far easier to write about then those who I know nothing about.

With that having been said, I have devised a way to have all of this in one easy place, a list of questions to answer about any character for any setting so that I can have a complete history, personality, and everything else all at my finger tips. How often have you started on the third chapter, or even the third page, and had to go back to the beginning and remind yourself that “gee, her hair was blond, not red.”

This list of questions makes that a lot easier. For convenience I have print ready versions here for page 1 and page 2. For those of you who do not think there is enough room to write what you need to, or want a digital vertion here is a list that you can cut and paste into a word processor, and use it as much as you like. If you need explanations on any of the questions, or advice on answering one, send a comment, I am sure someone will love to answer it.

**Remember**: The questions are about your character, not about you, so answer appropriately. Keep in mind that these questions are not all necessary for every character, in fact for bit parts you may only want to answer a couple of them. This was designed for the lead character of a novel in mind, and you will have to adjust it as necessary. This was also designed with fantasy and SF stories in mind, so some questions are specifically geared to those genres. Also, some of these have been changed slightly from the originals posted on the pages above, but it all boils down to the same thing.
